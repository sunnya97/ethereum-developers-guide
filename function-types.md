## Contract Structure

###### [Overview of Contract Structure](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/structure-of-a-contract.html) \[2 min read\]

This short section of the Solidity docs gives a quick recap of the major building blocks we've seen so far, including an extra one called events, which we will be going over soon.

###### [Restricting Access](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/layout-of-source-files.html#importing-other-source-files) \[2 min read\]

In this section of the Solidity Docs, we will read about how to use function modifiers that we learned about in the previous section to place restrictions on the execution of a smart contract function.
