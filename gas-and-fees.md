## Gas and Fees

In Ethereum, the concept of "turing-completeness" is actually a bit of a red herring.  If the VM were truly turing-complete, it is possible that it may never halt.  For this reason, Ethereum implements something called gas in order to measure the computation required by contract execution, both in order to compensate miners and to provide a bound on code execution.
