## Public-Private Key Cryptography

Now that we understand hash functions, we will explore the second fundamental cryptographic primitive, public-private key cryptography.

This quick video clip from Blockchain at Berkeley explains the value of why we need public and private keys on the blockchain.  It creates an analogy between the public and private key pair of a cryptographic identity to an email address and password pair.  It also gives a sense of scale to the magnitude of the number of public keys.

This video from DecypherTV gives a great demo of how public-private key pairs work in the Ethereum blockchain.  Using tools like Web3, EthereumJS, and eth3r.co, Jordan Leigh shows the fundamentals of key generation and even a little bit of an introduction to using Etherscan.
